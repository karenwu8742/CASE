# Implementation of CASE Redesign using basic HTML, CSS, Javascript

# Project Goals: We are redesigning the registration process of Configuration and Administration of SCS Equipment (CASE), a module of the wider SCS Computing Facilities. The goal of this project is to design a user experience that offers clarity and efficiency to both new and existing users of the system. By conducting user centered research focused on the usability of the system, this will enable our team to produce a prototype for a user interface that accomplishes the above goals.
